                    Nice to meet you! I'm Laura: <b>designer</b>, cat lover and
                    amateur cook.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My journey with design began at the age of 12, when I read
                    <b>"The Non-Designer’s Design Book"</b>. That early spark
                    led me to pursue a technical course in Multimedia, where I
                    studied design fundamentals alongside Advertising,
                    Photography, and Videomaking.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While earning my bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design, I was
                    introduced to UX Design — and everything changed. I landed
                    an internship at Itaú Unibanco, Brazil’s largest bank and
                    one of the country’s most respected design institutions.
                    During my time there, I realized that UX Design had the
                    power to drive real impact and solve complex business
                    problems. I was hooked.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It’s been over six years since that first encounter with
                    Product Design, and I’m still deeply passionate about the
                    craft. I love bringing ideas to life, collaborating with
                    peers, and shaping concepts into thoughtful, effective
                    solutions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and baking, spending time
                    with my cat Olívia, and reading. I’m also learning to play
                    the guitar and working on my German. If you'd like to chat
                    about design, collaboration, or just grab a coffee and
                    exchange ideas — feel free to reach out. I’m always up for a
                    good conversation.
