                        <p>
                            At Freeletics, most users purchase their
                            subscriptions through the website, but their
                            day-to-day interaction with the product happens
                            entirely in the app. When it came time to cancel,
                            this disconnect led to confusion: there was no clear
                            way to manage subscription settings from within the
                            app itself.
                        </p>

                        <div class="spacer-max"></div>
                        <p>
                            The result? A wave of support tickets to the
                            Customer Experience Team and a string of negative
                            reviews in the App Stores. Not only did this hurt
                            our support team‚Äôs bandwidth, but it also damaged
                            user trust and potentially discouraged new users
                            from signing up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The goal was, then, designing an Offboarding Flow
                            within the app that would:
                        </p>

                                Make cancelling the subscription easy enough to
                                build trust and let users go in a good note,
                                still satisfied with the product
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                At the same time, try to reduce the number of
                                active cancellations by offering alternatives
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            To understand why users were cancelling their
                            subscriptions, I analyzed results from our ongoing
                            <b>Cancellation Survey</b> ‚Äî a SurveyMonkey pop-up
                            that appears right after someone cancels via the
                            website. While the data provided useful insights, it
                            came with a catch: only a small percentage of users
                            actually respond to it (<b> less than 15%</b>), so
                            results should be taken with a grain of salt.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In parallel, I reviewed complaints from both the
                            <b>App Store</b> and <b>Google Play</b> reviews. One
                            theme popped up repeatedly, and it wasn‚Äôt news to
                            the team:
                            <b
                                >subscriptions renewed automatically without any
                                reminder</b
                            >. While users were clearly frustrated by this, the
                            <b>auto-renewal model</b> was a deliberate business
                            decision, and, so far, not something up for change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also explored how other products handled
                            subscription cancellations to gather inspiration.
                            The most striking example was <b>Spotify</b> ‚Äî a
                            relevant comparison, since purchases there can also
                            originate from various platforms. At former times,
                            they also added a <b>‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù playlist</b> to the
                            flow. It brought a light, human touch to a tedious
                            and transactional process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Taking all of this into account a pattern began to
                            emerge: most cancellations were driven by a few
                            recurring and sometimes preventable
                            <b>frustrations</b>. That sparked an idea:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <b>
                                What if we acknowledged these pain points
                                upfront ‚Äî and offered timely, targeted solutions
                                before the user even hit ‚Äúcancel‚Äù?

                            After identifying the main reasons users were
                            cancelling, I brought a proposal to the team:
                            <b
                                >Start the cancellation flow with a short survey
                                to gather more reliable data.</b
                            >
                            This would help us better understand what users felt
                            was missing and turn that into actionable insights.
                            Right after completing the survey, users would land
                            on a screen that addressed their specific concern.
                            Wherever possible, we‚Äôd offer a solution to help
                            them stay with Freeletics while still giving them
                            the option to cancel if they chose to.

                            I translated this idea into a wireframe and brought
                            it to our <b>pre-refinement meeting</b>. This is a
                            session where I present early-stage design ideas for
                            feedback from developers and the Product Manager.
                            (Curious about how I run these meetings? I wrote
                            this post [TK WITH LINK] explaining the format and
                            why it works.) During this discussion, we uncovered
                            two important opportunities:
                        </p>

                        <ul class="narrow-list">
                            <li>
                                <b
                                    >We could directly address the top
                                    cancellation reasons</b
                                >
                                by offering meaningful alternatives like pausing
                                subscription.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Subscription management varied by platform</b
                                >, meaning the flow had to adapt based on
                                whether the user subscribed via the App Store,
                                Google Play, or our website.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            I also partnered with the Product Manager to pitch
                            an optional <b>renewal reminder feature</b>. This
                            was aimed at users who still liked the product but
                            wanted to avoid the dreaded surprise charges. In
                            this conversation with the team, we also agreed that
                            it wouldn‚Äôt be feasible to address every
                            cancellation reason from the start. Instead, we
                            decided to focus on the most common and actionable
                            ones: <b>unexpected renewals</b> and users wanting
                            to <b>take a break due to injury or pregnancy</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To keep delivery manageable, we split the work into
                            two phases:
                        </p>

                        <ol class="narrow-list">

                                <b>The new cancellation flow,</b> offering
                                renewal reminders and the option to pause the
                                subscription, and
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>A redesign of the plan page</b>, giving users
                                more clarity around subscription status and
                                billing details upfront.
                            </li>

                        <p>
                            After aligning with the team, I had a
                            <b>clear picture</b> of what was feasible to
                            deliver, including the
                            <b>technical limitations</b> of each platform and
                            the <b>content flexibility</b> we had. With the PM‚Äôs
                            support to introduce a <b>renewal reminder flow</b>,
                            it was time to turn insights into screens.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My main goal was to create an experience that
                            allowed us to <b>gather data</b> and
                            <b>offer alternatives</b> without overwhelming
                            users. After all, cancellation is a
                            <b>sensitive moment</b>, and by this point, many
                            users are already feeling <b>frustrated</b> or
                            <b>let down</b> by the brand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I focused on keeping the flow <b>simple</b>,
                            <b>clear</b>, and <b>user-guided</b>. The design was
                            built around <b>three core templates</b>, adapted to
                            each user context:
                        </p>

                        <ul class="narrow-list">

                            <li>Solution screen</li>

                        <p>
                            Inspired by Spotify‚Äôs ‚Äúgoodbye playlist,‚Äù I also
                            proposed a <b>Goodbye Workout</b>: a session users
                            could save and complete later. It was meant to leave
                            them with a positive final touchpoint.
                            Unfortunately, due to time and development
                            constraints, we had to discard this idea.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For the <b>Plan Page redesign</b>, my focus was on
                            <b>clarity and predictability</b>. I wanted users to
                            quickly understand their subscription details such
                            as status, renewal dates, and purchase method
                            without digging through menus or reading through
                            walls of text. I introduced
                            <b>color-coded tags</b> for subscription status and
                            rearranged the layout to make key information more
                            scannable at a glance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As mentioned earlier, each platform came with its
                            own limitations and capabilities when it came to
                            subscription management. This meant I had to design
                            and deliver <b>slightly different flows</b> for
                            users who purchased subscriptions via
                            <b>Android, iOS, and the Web</b>: sometimes just one
                            extra sentence, sometimes an additional button.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To keep the handoff organized and manageable, I
                            structured the documentation in
                            <b>clearly separated sections</b>, one for each
                            platform. Each flow was clustered in its own area,
                            with visual cues and clear annotations to help
                            developers quickly navigate the file.
                            <b>Flowcharts and directional arrows</b>
                            are a must for me in any dev handoff, so I included
                            them as part of the package.

                            The <b>Plan Page handoff</b> followed a similar
                            logic. Since there were many plan variations and
                            combinations of details that could appear, I decided
                            to deliver this part as a <b>single-page guide</b>.
                            It included all the possible variant options and
                            edge cases in one place ‚Äî a strategy to help both me
                            and the developers stay aligned and avoid confusion

                            The PM recommended launching the new flow as an
                            <b>A/B test </b>to assess whether making
                            cancellations easier would lead to an increase in
                            churn. The opposite happened: while more users
                            explored the new flow,
                            <b>
                                fewer actually followed through with

                        <p>
                            The <b>subscription reminder</b> proved to be the
                            most effective alternative, with <b>22% </b>of users
                            selecting it and choosing to stay. The
                            <b>pause subscription</b>
                            option was less popular, likely due to its limited
                            availability ‚Äî only for Android users via the Play
                            Store, and only in certain countries.

                        <p>
                            With the addition of the subscription reminder
                            feature, we managed to
                            <b>retain more than 1k users </b>who were about to
                            leave Freeletics ‚Äî resulting in a

                        <p>
                            This flow reminded me that good UX isn‚Äôt just about
                            guiding users ‚Äî it‚Äôs about listening, even when
                            they‚Äôre halfway out the door. Turns out, helping
                            people leave gracefully is sometimes the best way to
                            make them stay.
